# Features based on traffic data
Your traffic_data.csv includes timestamp, sensor ID, vehicle count, average speed, weather condition, and incident labels, giving you a strong foundation for feature engineering. Here are some potential additional features to enhance your model:
Time-Based Features
- Hour of the Day: Extracted from timestamp, useful for identifying rush hours.
- Day of the Week: Helps capture weekday vs. weekend traffic patterns.
- Seasonality: Categorize timestamps by seasons (Winter, Spring, etc.).
- Holiday Indicator: Mark public holidays that may impact traffic flow.
Weather Impact Metrics
- Weather Category Encoding: Convert weather_condition into numerical or one-hot encoded values.
- Extreme Weather Flag: Indicator for severe conditions (e.g., heavy rain, snowstorm).
- Temperature (if available): Could be inferred from seasonal data to assess impact.
Traffic Flow & Speed Variations
- Speed Change Rate: Measure sudden drops/spikes in avg_speed.
- Congestion Level: Define thresholds based on vehicle_count and avg_speed.
- Traffic Density by Sensor: Aggregate previous readings to estimate congestion per sensor.
Historical Incident Patterns
- Incident Frequency per Sensor: Count past incidents per sensor_id.
- Incident Trend: Rolling window statistics to identify time-based risk patterns.
- Incident Hotspots: Geospatial mapping if coordinates are available.
Aggregated Features
- Moving Averages: Apply rolling average on speed, vehicle count.
- Previous Hour Speed Change: Compare current speed to the last hour‚Äôs speed.
- Traffic Spike Detection: Calculate deviations from expected vehicle count.
These features can boost predictive accuracy by capturing deeper insights into traffic patterns, weather effects, and incident likelihood.
